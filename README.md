# Recreated-Nexter-
Nexter realtor website recreated, This is a website made for selecting getting in contact with realtors who could get you affordable or priced housing according to your taste and budget. It was made as a pre-cursor to learning CSS grid.
## A Realtor site
  As part of my journey to becoming a full fledged Front-web developer, I learnt how to use CSS grids. This project is all about CSS grids.
Nesting CSS grids and creating different components in the grid, also combining flexbox with CSS grids.

## Updated the website
  Added some new sections to it, like the story, header and realtor section... leveraging the upside to CSS grids 'auto-fit, min-content, and max-content' values using the 'minmax()' funstion. Implementing the CSS grids came quite fluid.

## Writing Media Queries
  Despite using CSS grids for our overrall page layout, some part of our code still requires(d) media queries to make it responsive and user friendly for different screen sizes. *28/03/2022*
